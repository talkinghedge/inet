In this example the network consists of one client and one server only.

The default TCP implementation can be replaced using the StandardHost's tcpType 
parameter. This example uses the Network Simulation Cradle library which contains
real-world tcp implementations taken from Linux 2.6, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and lwIP.
It can be downloaded from: http://www.wand.net.nz/~stj2/nsc/

The NSC library must be present in <inet_root>/3rdparty/nsc-0.5.1 directory. 
If you have a different version of the library you MUST modify the 
'<inet_root>/src/makefrag' file and adjust the name and version number of the NSC 
distribution. You have to regenerate the makefiles after changing the 'makefrag' 
file. Execute:

  $ make makefiles

from the <inet_root> directory or rebuild INET from the IDE.

To successfully build INET with NSC support you must first compile the NSC libraries
in 3rdparty/nsc-0.5.1 . Execute:

  $ python scons.py

and then you should build INET:

  $ make

This example demonstrates how to use different TCP implementations on different hosts
in the same network. Just adjust the 'tcpType' parameter for the hosts that want to use
TCP implementations other than the default.
